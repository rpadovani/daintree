        <p>
          If you don't want to share your AWS keys with a random website
          (rightly so!), you can login with an OAuth provider of your choice,
          and generate temporary credentials with an
          <a
            href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/identity-pools.html"
            target="_blank"
            >AWS Identity Pool <gl-icon name="external-link" /> </a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daintree will authenticate through your OAuth provider, and then will
          exchange the OAuth token it receives from the provider with AWS
          credentials thanks to the AWS Identity Pool.
        </p>
        <p>
          The workflow has been thoroughly tested with AWS Cognito as OAuth
          provider, but Daintree has been coded to support any OAuth provider.
          If you find any issue, or if you are interested in a dedicated
          subdomain just for you, with the configuration data already hardcoded,
          please write to
          <a href="mailto:rpadovani@daintree.app">rpadovani@daintree.app</a>.
        </p>
        <h1 class="gl-banner-title">Parameters</h1>
        <p>
          For this workflow to work you need a well configured
          <a
            href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/role-based-access-control.html"
            target="_blank"
            >AWS Identity Pool <gl-icon name="external-link" /> </a
          >: you need then to specify the ID of such pool in the parameter
          <b>Cognito Identity Pool ID</b> during the login.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, Daintree needs to be authorized to invoke your OAuth
          provider: you need to create a dedicated client, with these
          parameters:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Callback URL(s):</b>
            https://daintree.app/cognito_callback.html,
            https://www.daintree.app/cognito_callback.html
          </li>
          <li><b>OAuth flow:</b> implicit grant</li>
          <li><b>OAuth scope:</b> openid</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Since Daintree uses the implicit grant flow (given there is no backend
          in the app) the OAuth client needs to do not have any client secret to
          work.
        </p>

        <p>
          After you created your OAuth client, you can login in Daintree. You
          need to specify your OAuth client ID and the URL for the login to you
          OAuth provider during the login.
        </p>
