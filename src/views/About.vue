        <p>
          The AWS Console is an amazing piece of software: it has hundreds of
          thousands of features, it is reliable, and it is the front end of an
          incredible world. However, as any software, it is not perfect:
          sometimes is a bit slow, so many features can be confusing, and it is
          clear that it has evolved over time, so there are a lot of different
          styles, and if it would be made from scratch today, some choices would
          probably be different.
        </p>

        <p>
          Daintree has born wanting to fix one particular problem of the AWS
          Console: the impossibility to see resources from multiple regions in
          the same view. Please consider the Daintree's project start in the
          April 2020, so it is still quite young: a lot of feature are missing,
          and if you like,

            <img
              class="col-12"

            <h5>Multiple region support</h5>
            <p>
              The main reason Daintree exists is to display resources from
              multiple regions in the same screen: why limiting to one, when you
              can have 25?
            </p>

            <p>
              Also, changing enabled regions doesn't require a full page reload,
              but just a click on a flag: Daintree will smartly require
              resources from the freshly enabled regions.
            </p>

            <h5>Fast role switching</h5>
            <p>
              If you belong to an AWS organization, and you have multiple
              accounts, you probably switch often role: such operation on the
              original AWS console requires a full page reload, and it always
              brings you to the homepage.
            </p>

            <p>
              On Daintree, changing roles will only reload the resources in the
              page you are currently in, without having to wait for a full page
              reload!

            <h5>Coherent interface</h5>
            <p>
              Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so claiming Daintree is more
              beautiful than the original console would be silly: however,
              Daintree has been built to be coherent: all the styling is made
              thanks to the
              <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui" target="_blank"
                >Gitlab UI project <gl-icon name="external-link" /></a
              >, and the illustrations are made by Katerina Limpitsouni from
              <a href="https://undraw.co/" target="_blank"

            </p>
            <p>
              This guarantees a coherent and polished experience all over the
              application.

              The project doesn't have any commercial goal, and as explained in

            <p>
              Daintree heavily uses Javascript (with Vue.js) to do not have to
              reload the page: also, it tries to perform as few operations as
              possible to keep always updated on your resources. In this way,
              you don't waste your precious time waiting for the page to load.

            <h5>And much more!</h5>
            <p>
              While implementing Daintree, new features have been introduced to
              make life easier to whoever uses it. As an example, you can create
              Internet Gateway and attach them to a VPC in the same screen,
              without having to wait for the gateway to be created. Or, while
              visualizing a security groups, you can click on the linked
              security groups, without having to look for them or remember
              complicated IDs. If you have any idea on how to improve workflows,
              <router-link to="/contribute"
                >please share it with developers</router-link
              >!
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
            <img
              style="max-height: 200px"
              src="/assets/undraw_To_the_stars_qhyy.svg"
              alt="To the stars!"
              class="mx-auto d-block"

        <h5>Supported components</h5>
        <p>
          Daintree is still at early stages of development, so the number of
          supported resources is quite limited.
          <router-link to="/contribute"
            >You can report which feature you'd like to see to the developers,
            or you can implement them!</router-link
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Daintree allows to view VPCs, Subnets, Internet Gateways, Nat
          Gateways, Route Tables, Elastic IPs, Security Groups, Instances, SNS,
          and SQS. You can also create, delete, and edit some of these
          resources. Development is ongoing, so remember to check the
          <router-link to="/changelog">changelog</router-link> from time to
          time.
